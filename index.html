    <h2> I am involved in many clubs at my school. My favorite though would have to be FBLA (Future Business Leaders Of America). Through this club we not only have fun but we learn business ethics for the real world. I have been a loyal member for four years, 2 of which I have served as treasurer, and one I have served as Vice President. Every year all the members of FBLA get together to build an amazing float for the homecoming parade. We also participate in Reginal and State Competitions. Freshman year I competed in Intro to business. Sophomore year I competed in Computer Applications. Junior year I also competed in Computer Applictions and made it to Regionals (getting first place) and State (not placing but made memories I will never forget).
